    <p class="meta">A practical companion to The Delegation Law and the Delegation Readiness Index (DRI) · Written by Henning du Preez, 2025 · Licensed under CC BY 4.0</p>

    <h2>What this page is</h2>
    <p>
      This page shows how to apply the <strong>Delegation Readiness Index (DRI)</strong> to real delegation decisions using a few grounded examples.
      It is designed to be calm, concrete, and usable — especially when the decision feels urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      DRI is not here to “slow you down.” It is here to help you move fast <em>without</em> quietly weakening the system you are responsible for.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use DRI (in one minute)</h2>
    <div class="rule">
      <p><strong>DRI checks three things — in order.</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Structural Alignment</strong>: Are we removing the real constraint, or just automating around it?</li>
        <li><strong>Propagation Stability</strong>: As reliance spreads, do outcomes remain sound?</li>
        <li><strong>System Integrity</strong>: If it’s wrong, misused, or attacked — can the system recover cleanly?</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="small"><strong>Rule:</strong> If any dimension fails, delegation is structurally premature. Strength in one cannot “cover” weakness in another.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Onboarding: what the examples will (and won’t) do</h2>
    <p>
      Each example below is intentionally short.
      It does not try to convince you of a worldview.
      It simply shows how DRI makes the decision <em>decidable</em>.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Tip: When reading, notice how often the failure mode is not “the system isn’t smart enough,” but “the rule is not finished,”
      or “the recovery path is not real.”
    </p>

    <h2 id="ex6">Example 6 — Works Small, Weakens the System at Scale</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p><span class="pill">Operations</span> <span class="pill">Scheduling</span> <span class="pill">Scale effects</span></p>

      <h3>Delegation Candidate</h3>
      <p>Using an AI system to automatically schedule customer service agents (shifts, breaks, and coverage) based on demand forecasts.</p>

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        A small team adopts automated scheduling to reduce manager workload and keep coverage aligned to expected demand.
        Early results look good. Reliance grows.
      </p>

      <h3>1) Structural Alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it removes:</strong> manual scheduling effort and delays</li>
        <li><strong>What remains:</strong> the business rules for coverage are reasonably clear</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Holds</p>

      <h3>2) Propagation Stability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>As the team grows, edge cases multiply (fatigue, fairness, skill mix, training time, personal constraints).</li>
        <li>The system optimises “coverage,” but important human signals can be treated as noise.</li>
        <li>Over time, people stop raising issues because “the system decided.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Marginal</p>

      <h3>3) System Integrity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bad schedules often show up late (burnout, morale decay, resignations).</li>
        <li>Accountability can blur (“Who approved this schedule?”).</li>
        <li>Recovery is possible, but usually after cost has already been paid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Fails</p>

      <h3>Final DRI Verdict</h3>
      <p class="verdict">Not delegable at scale</p>
      <p class="muted">
        The delegation removes effort, but it can quietly erode responsibility and recovery.
        A safer path is to keep the automation narrow (suggestions + human sign-off), and treat “recovery time” as a first-class metric.
      </p>

    <!-- ====================================================== -->
    <!-- Example 7 -->
    <!-- ====================================================== -->
    <h2 id="ex7">Example 7 — Delegating Company Strategy</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p><span class="pill">Leadership</span> <span class="pill">Strategy</span> <span class="pill">Judgment</span></p>

      <h3>Delegation Candidate</h3>
      <p>Letting an AI system define company strategy based on market data, trends, and simulations.</p>

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        A leadership team wants to reduce bias and speed up decision-making.
        They propose “data-driven strategy” where the system selects markets, positioning, and priorities.
      </p>

      <h3>1) Structural Alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The real limitation:</strong> uncertainty about the future, not lack of information.</li>
        <li><strong>The missing prerequisite:</strong> a stable rule that defines what “correct strategy” is.</li>
        <li><strong>What strategy actually does:</strong> it commits the organisation to a chosen future under uncertainty.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Fails</p>

      <h3>2) Propagation Stability</h3>
      <p class="muted">Not evaluated — Structural Alignment failure halts delegation.</p>

      <h3>3) System Integrity</h3>
      <p class="muted">Not evaluated — Structural Alignment failure halts delegation.</p>

      <h3>Final DRI Verdict</h3>
      <p class="verdict">Structurally premature</p>
      <p class="muted">
        The safer use of machine intelligence here is <em>support</em>, not delegation:
        improve visibility, model scenarios, and surface second-order consequences — while humans remain accountable for the strategic commitment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ====================================================== -->
    <!-- Example 8 -->
    <!-- ====================================================== -->
    <h2 id="ex8">Example 8 — Narrow, Rule-Bound Defensive Automation</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p><span class="pill">Defense</span> <span class="pill">Reaction time</span> <span class="pill">Strict scope</span></p>

      <h3>Delegation Candidate</h3>
      <p>Automatically triggering a defensive intercept when an incoming projectile meets a strictly defined threat profile.</p>

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        Human reaction time is insufficient to respond safely.
        The system is designed to operate in a narrow, well-defined envelope with explicit constraints.
      </p>

      <h3>1) Structural Alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What it removes:</strong> reaction-speed limitation</li>
        <li><strong>What remains human:</strong> rule definition, scope, oversight, and accountability</li>
        <li><strong>Key property:</strong> the system executes a fixed rule, it does not invent one</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Holds</p>

      <h3>2) Propagation Stability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scaling increases consistency, not ambiguity.</li>
        <li>Misuse is constrained by the system’s strict operating envelope.</li>
        <li>The rule does not drift simply because adoption increases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Holds</p>

      <h3>3) System Integrity</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Actions are logged, attributable, and auditable.</li>
        <li>There are clear disable mechanisms and safe modes.</li>
        <li>Scope is narrow enough that failure does not “spill” into unrelated domains.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Holds (within strict bounds)</p>

      <h3>Final DRI Verdict</h3>
      <p class="verdict">Delegable — within a narrowly defined scope</p>
      <p class="muted">
        This example is included to show a non-obvious point:
        delegation can be structurally safe when the rule is explicit, the scope is tight, and recovery is real — even in serious domains.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ====================================================== -->
    <!-- Example 9 -->
    <!-- ====================================================== -->
    <h2 id="ex9">Example 9 — Delegating Cultural Norm Enforcement</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p><span class="pill">Society</span> <span class="pill">Norms</span> <span class="pill">Rule drift</span></p>

      <h3>Delegation Candidate</h3>
      <p>Using AI to automatically detect and enforce “acceptable speech” or “approved behaviour” across a platform or society.</p>

      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>
        The intention is often understandable: reduce harm, reduce conflict, and keep environments usable.
        The challenge is that norms are not static — they evolve across communities and time.
      </p>

      <h3>1) Structural Alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The real limitation:</strong> ongoing disagreement about values and meaning, not enforcement capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>The missing prerequisite:</strong> a stable rule that stays legitimate across contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk shape:</strong> the enforcement system effectively becomes a rule-maker.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="verdict">Verdict: Fails</p>

      <h3>2) Propagation Stability</h3>
      <p class="muted">Not evaluated — Structural Alignment failure halts delegation.</p>

      <h3>3) System Integrity</h3>
      <p class="muted">Not evaluated — Structural Alignment failure halts delegation.</p>

      <h3>Final DRI Verdict</h3>
      <p class="verdict">Structurally premature</p>
      <p class="muted">
        A safer approach is governance-by-visibility: make rules explicit, allow appeal, preserve accountability,
        and keep humans responsible for the rule — even if machines assist with detection and routing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <p>
      The practical lesson across these examples is simple:
      <strong>delegation becomes safe when the rule is finished, the scope is bounded, and recovery is real.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When those conditions are missing, the most constructive move is usually not “no forever,” but “not yet” —
      and then define what must become true to make delegation ready.
    </p>

    <h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Why these four examples were chosen</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Example 6</strong> shows a common pattern: “looks great early” → “quiet costs later.” This is the signature of weak System Integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Example 7</strong> shows a category mistake: delegating commitment under uncertainty when no stable rule exists.</li>
        <li><strong>Example 8</strong> shows that seriousness of domain is not the deciding factor. Structure is.</li>
        <li><strong>Example 9</strong> shows where rule drift and legitimacy issues make “automation” functionally become “rule-making.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reader safety and tone (intentional)</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        This page is written to keep the reader safe to think.
        It avoids urgency language and avoids framing the reader as “at risk” for asking the question.
        DRI is a decision aid, not a moral judgment.
      </p>

      <h3>How to extend this page without dilution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add more examples only if each one fails or passes for a single clear structural reason.</li>
        <li>Keep the same three-step structure (Alignment → Stability → Integrity) to prevent drift.</li>
        <li>If an example becomes debatable, tighten the scope rather than adding more words.</li>
      </ul>
